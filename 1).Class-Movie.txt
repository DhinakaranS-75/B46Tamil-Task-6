Class-Movie

a).Write a constructor for the class Movie, which takes a String representing the title of the movie, a String representing the studio, and a String representing the rating as its arguments, and sets the respective class properties to these values?

Ans:
  class Movie {
     constructor(title, studio, rating = "PG") {
       this.title = title;
       this.studio = studio;
      this.rating = rating;
    }
  }

b).The constructor for the class Movie will set the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided?

Ans:
	class Movie {
 		 constructor(title, studio, rating = "PG") {
   			 this.title = title;
   			 this.studio = studio;
    			this.rating = rating;
  		}
	}






c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of base type Movie as its argument, and returns a new array of only those movies in the input array with a rating of "PG". You may assume the input array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full?


Ans:
		class VijayMovie {
  			static getPG(movies) {
    				return movies.filter(movie => movie.rating === "PG");
 		 	}
		}



d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the class Movie with the title “Casino Royale”, the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13”?


Ans:


		const casinoRoyale = new VijayMovie("Casino Royale", "Eon Productions", "PG-13");
